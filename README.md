# Root Finding algorithms

This program calculates the root of a function through different algorithms
and outputs the number of iterations each algorithm needed to find the root ( with a tolerance).
Following algorithms are implemented:

- bisection
- secant method
- newton method
- regula falsi
- brent
- dekker
- 3 modern approaches
